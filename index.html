                    Gerrit Rietveld Academie, Graphic Design Department — 3rd Year Trip (12–20 Oct. 2025):<br>
                    When Felix joined the Gerrit Rietveld Academie Graphic Design Department’s 3rd-year trip to the residency 
                    <i>Habitat</i> in Italy as a tutor, I was able to join as well. During the nine-day trip, we worked together, 
                    went hiking, and participated in various workshops, which culminated in a radio event. I was responsible 
                    for coding the website that streamed the radio.</figcaption>

                Lunch at the Studio:<br>We usually cooked our lunch at the studio. It became a kind of daily routine: soup from <i>Ekoplaza</i>, a salad made with romaine, cabbage, cucumber, yellow paprika, and tomato, fresh sourdough from our wonderful neighbour <i>Levain et le Vin</i>, cottage cheese, Gouda, and some fruit for dessert. Sometimes we went to the Surinamese restaurant nearby for salted cod sandwiches or chicken soup with rice. Occasionally, we also stopped by <i>Levain et le Vin</i> for their sandwich of the day.<br>

                    <i>“Something is Burning”</i>, a two-day event with David Bennewith (6–7 Sep. 2025):<br> Felix explores how graphic design can intersect with other fields, and he often uses his own studio as an exhibition space to provide graphic designers with a platform to present three-dimensional works beyond publication-based formats. During the first weekend of September, he organized an event in collaboration with Amsterdam-based graphic designer David Bennewith. I assisted with the overall build-up of the event and helped run the bar during the event.

              Projects I Worked On:<br>While working with Felix, I was able to take on a wide range of projects (Publications, Posters, Typefaces, Woodworks etc...). I worked with him on the overall design of <i>De Gids</i>, a literary magazine based in Amsterdam which Felix is in charge of designing, and I also helped with occasional poster commissions. Since the studio needed an open/closed sign, I designed a wood-hinge structure myself and built it. I designed the custom typeface <i>Waanzin</i> for the <i>Waanzinnig</i> issue of <i>De Gids</i>, released in November, and I am currently working on one of the typefaces Felix has been developing.

                  <i>Deep Spring Karaoke Bar</i> (22 Nov. 2025):<br>At the end of my internship, Felix encouraged me to organize an event of my own in his studio. Together with Malva Askerup, Anja Aurand, and Ivo Blackwood, I organized the Deep Spring Karaoke Bar event. With support from César Rogers and Yuri Sato at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie Offset Printing Workshop, we produced beautiful offset gradient prints to use as curtains for the event, and with help from Tjobo Kho of <i>No Kiss Print</i>, we were able to create the perfect event flyer. It was a day that really showed Felix’s generosity and support, and one that left me with truly beautiful memories.
